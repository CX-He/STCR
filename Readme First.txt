To run this code, you need an additional function provided by Dr. Lina Zhuang, which you can download from her homepage:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinaZhuang/HSI-denoiser-GLF/master/LowRankRecovery3.p
Or you can directly borrow the classical singular value thresholding for closer performance.
