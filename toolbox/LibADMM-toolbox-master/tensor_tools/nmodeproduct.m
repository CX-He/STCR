function B = nmodeproduct(A,M,n)
% Calculates the n-Mode Product of a Tensor A and a Matrix M
% 
% B = nmodeproduct(A,M,n)
% 
% B = A (x)_n M .. According to the Definition in De Lathauwer (2000)
%
% with:
% A:    (I_1 x I_2 x .. I_n x .. I_N) .. ->  n is in [1..N]
% M:    (J   x I_n)
% B:    (I_1 x I_2 x .. J x   .. I_N)
%
% note: "(x)_n" is the operator between the tensor and the matrix

dimvec = size(A);

if (length(dimvec)<n || n<1)
    error('nmodeproduct: n is not within the order range of tensor A ');

% shift A to prepare flattening: (i.e. make dimension 1 (columns) to 'n', the one we would like to replace)
Ash = shiftdim(A,n-1);

% save the target dimensions of B (we replace the 1st dimension, because
% thats the one affected by the matrix multiplication 
% i.e. this dimension changes from I_n to J
dimvecB = size(Ash);
dimvecB(1) = size(M,1);


% multiply while flattening.. i.e. we first flatten the matrix, so that we
% have a matrix; as an array of flattened vectors drawn from the tensor
% second we multiply those vectors with our matrix, resulting in a
% dimension change of the output vector. the output vectors are then again
% saved as a matrix, representing an array of those vectors.
B = M*Ash(:,:);

% wrap the flattened vector-array back into the previously saved tensor shape
B = reshape(B,dimvecB);

% shift the dimensions back! so that only dimension n has changed from I_n to J
B = shiftdim(B,length(dimvecB)-n+1);

% and we re done!
