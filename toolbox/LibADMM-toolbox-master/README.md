# LibADMM Toolbox

## 1. Introduction

This toolbox solves many sparse, low-rank matrix and low-rank tensor optimization problems by using M-ADMM developed in our paper <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. 

## 2. List of Problems

The table below gives the list of problems solved in our toolbox. See more details in the manual at <a href="../publications/2016-software-LibADMM.pdf" class="textlink" target="_blank">https://canyilu.github.io/publications/2016-software-LibADMM.pdf</a>.

## 4. Version History
- Version 1.0 was released on June, 2016.
- Version 1.1 was released on June, 2018. Some key differences are below:
  + Add a new model about low-rank tensor recovery from Gaussian measurements based on tensor nuclear norm and the corresponding function lrtr_Gaussian_tnn.m
  + Update several functions to improve the efficiency, including prox_tnn.m, tprod.m, tran.m, tubalrank.m, and nmodeproduct.m
  + Update the three example functions: example_sparse_models.m, example_low_rank_matrix_models.m, and example_low_rank_tensor_models.m
  + Remove the test on image data and some unnecessary functions
